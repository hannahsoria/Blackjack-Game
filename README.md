# :hearts: Blackjack Simulation
This is a simulation of when a game of blackjack is played out between the dealer and a player. The simulation returns what each player had in their hand, what their total was, and who won. This code is made up of different classes each in their own file: Card, Hand, Deck, Blackjack, and Simulation. Essentially, when the final class is run, which is the simulation, the game is played through 1000 times and the total player wins, dealer wins, how many were tied, and the percentage of each are returned.

# :spades: Results
The simulation returns the number of wins and the percentage for each: the dealer, the player and ties. The results make sense that they are random but the percentages of wins on either side are higher than the number of ties. This is because it is more likely for one to win than for them to achieve the same number. The dealer wins more than the player because when the player exceeds 21 the dealer automatically wins without having to draw or continue playing. Therefore statistically the dealer will have a higher percentage of wins.
